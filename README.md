For my corpus, I will be using two playlist made specifically of heavy metal songs. One of those was made by me around a year ago and the other is made by Spotify itself. I’m interested in the difference between the musical elements of each playlist. I wonder if my perception of ‘heavy metal’ will be the same as Spotify’s and what exactly the differences are. 
In this corpus I’m comparing the musical elements that Spotify gives me of the two playlists. I think there will be some differences, my playlist will likely be a bit ‘heavier’, or just more extreme, but overall I think the proportions will be mainly the same. 
The tracks in the Spotify playlist are quite representative of the the heavy metal genre, although there might be some outliers. I do think that my own playlist might be a bit less representative, but that is what I’m trying to find out, how close I am to the actual genre. 
There are no typical tracks on either of the playlists that I am using. However, there are some artists that return regularly. In my own playlist they are Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and Testament, and in the Spotify playlist they are Powerwolf, Volbeat and Iron Maiden.

The graphics I made for this week represent the musical features of my own playlist. I made these to be able to compare them later on to the ones I will make of the Spotify playlist. Also, this way it's easier to see any outliers that should not be counted in any mean values. I color coördinated them so that low values are represented by red and high values by yellow. I could really not figure out how to remove the x axis values, so I just let it be.
